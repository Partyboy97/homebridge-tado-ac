Complies with ```Service.Thermostat```

## Installation

1. Install homebridge using: `npm install -g homebridge`

3. Update your configuration file. See `sample-config.json` in this repository for a sample.

## Configuration

Configuration sample:

```
"accessories": [
{
  "accessory": "TADO",
  "name": "Tado",
  "homeID": "homeID",
  "username": "usr",
  "password": "passwd"
}
]
```

```
To get the username and password you can create use the tado API (/createAppUser) shown below

OR you can use something like charles proxy to intercept your device traffic and find out your homeID/username/password

If sniffing them:
- Your homeID will be a 5 digit number
- Your username will be your homeID followed by an underscore and your device nickname
- Your password will be generated by the app

```
